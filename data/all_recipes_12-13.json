Simply overturn the tray being careful to support the chocolate. Remember, the chocolate base will assume any pattern that exists on the tray. Make sure the tray is big enough for the bottom of your mold. If you do not have a tray, simply use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered chocolate onto a sheet of parchment paper, being sure to spread it all the way to the edges. Lift the chocolate-covered paper by its corners and move it to a clean space on your work surface. Let the chocolate harden slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. The chocolate should be firm enough to cut but it will not be hard.

The thickness of the tube will be determined by the size of your body mold. This piece will support the body so make sure it is long and thick enough to hold it. Set the tube on end and fill it with white chocolate. Allow this to set until hard. Pull the parchment paper with the chocolate inside out of the tube. Use white chocolate to glue the pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the body against it.\u00a0\n            ", "\n              For the Body: Start by drizzling both white and bittersweet chocolate in the mold.

Dipping your fingers in chocolate adds a thin layer of chocolate to the mold, which makes it easier to create the marble pattern. When the mold is marbleized, fill it with white chocolate. Pour excess chocolate back into the bowl. Place the bust upside down on a wire rack over parchment paper. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip clean with a paring knife. Allow to harden. Using a paintbrush, paint another layer of white chocolate. Allow to harden and repeat until the chocolate is thick enough to support the structure. The inside of the bust should be evenly coated with chocolate.

To unmold, rest your thumbs on the outside, place your first two fingers on the inside and gently begin to lift the mold from the chocolate.

Using a hand-held immersion blender or whisk, combine all of the ingredients until smooth and homogenous. As the mixture cooks, the natural pectin in the fruit will cause the mixture to thicken. Continue to cook until it is thick, mixing constantly. To test for the correct consistency, dip a whisk in the mixture and hold horizontally in front of you. Watch as the mixture drips off the whisk and back into the pan. If the mixture stays on the whisk and beads up into small balls, like pearls, it is ready.

If you do not have a flexipan, you can pour the Pate de Fruit into a 10-inch bottomless tart mold or cake ring placed on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Let the Pate de Fruit cool and set, about 3 hours at room temperature. When the mixture has set, remove and roll each jewel in sugar. To unmold, run a sharp paring knife between the fruit and the mold and lift off the mold. (At this point the Pate de Fruit can be stored, well wrapped in plastic and in an airtight container, for up to 2 months.) Sprinkle the top of the Pate de Fruit with a thin layer of sugar and flip it onto another sheet of parchment paper. Remove the parchment that is now on top. Sprinkle this side with more sugar.

There are a variety of ways to temper.\u00a0\n            ", "\n              One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.\u00a0\n            ", "\n              Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.\u00a0\n            ", "\n              The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.\u00a0\n            ", "\n              A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.

The paper cone was 3 1/2 inches tall with a 2 1/2-inch diameter opening. You can use any mold that you like. If you use the paper cones, place them point side down inside small glasses to make it easy to fill them. Use a serrated knife to slice the pound cake into 1/2-inch thick layers. Use a round cutter to cut cake rounds the same diameter as the cone mold. Pour the heavy cream into a medium-size mixing bowl and whip to soft peaks with an electric mixer set on medium speed. At this stage, the whipped cream has the most volume. If you overwhip the cream, you will lose volume and the mousse will not be as light and airy as it should be. If you are using fruit flavored alcohol, fold it in with a rubber spatula, being careful not to deflate the cream. Carefully pour the warm melted chocolate into the mixture. If the chocolate is too warm, it will melt the whipped cream. If it is too cool, the chocolate will seize (harden) upon contact with the cooler mixture and you will have pieces of chocolate in your mousse. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold in the chocolate until completely incorporated. The chocolate mousse should be the same color throughout, with no streaks. Place the chocolate mousse in a large pastry bag (no tip). Drop a few cherries into the tip of each paper cone. Pipe the chocolate mousse into the cone so that it is about 1/4-inch from the top. Close each cone with 1 cake round, gently pressing the cake round into the mousse. Invert the cone and place it on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Place the desserts in the freezer for 2 hours. To make the chocolate decorations: Use a small offset spatula to spread some tempered chocolate on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Keep the thickness of the chocolate as even as possible, about 1/8-inch thick. Use a sharp paring knife to cut some long triangles of chocolate that are about 15 inches long with a 1 1/2-inch base. Cut 1 triangle for each dessert you are making. When the chocolate has set slightly, place it inside a large round tube or bucket. I made my tube of aluminum flashing that I taped into a 15-inch diameter. Place the chocolate triangles inside the tube and let the chocolate set. When set, remove the acetate from the tube. Peel off the parchment paper and break apart the curved triangles. This piece forms the moon for each dessert.\n            ", "\n              Make the chocolate sauce cups: Use a spoon to fill a round measuring tablespoon with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the spoon should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the spoon clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the spoon. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the spoon in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat to make 1 sauce cup for each dessert. Make a chocolate tube: Roll a piece of parchment paper into a tube that has a 2-inch diameter. Fill the tube with chocolate. Then invert it and let the excess chocolate flow back into the bowl. Spin the tube while inverted to ensure the inside is completely and evenly covered. Allow this to set until firm. Remove the parchment paper. Use a hot serrated knife to slice the tube into 1 1/2-inch wide slices. Cut 1 slice for each dessert. To do this, heat the knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to \"cut\" through the chocolate by melting it. Assemble the chocolate decoration: Dip the side of the tube piece in tempered chocolate and place the tube on a glass plate. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the moon to the top of the tube piece. Use more chocolate to adhere the chocolate sauce cup to the top of the moon. To unmold the dessert: Fill a bowl with very hot water. Dip the outside of the frozen dessert in the hot water for about 2 seconds. Be careful not to allow the water to seep into the opening. Invert the dessert and gently pinch the tip. The frozen dessert should release from the mold. To spray the dessert: Place a mixture of 50 percent cocoa butter and 50 percent chocolate in a saucepan. Heat it until warm. Make sure there are no lumps. Transfer this mixture to the container of the paint sprayer. Spray the dessert with this mixture to give it texture, color and contrast. Use an offset spatula to move the frozen dessert to the base of the chocolate moon. Fill a squeeze bottle with raspberry sauce and fill the chocolate sauce cup.\n            ", "\n              Sources: Laser thermometer Paint sprayer: art supply store\n            "], "difficulty": "Advanced", "recipe_name": "Chocolate Moon Dessert", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "2 hr 30 min", "servings": "10 desserts", "recipe_author": "Chocolate with Jacques Torres", "category_tags": ["Mixer Recipes", "European Recipes", "French Recipes", "Fruit", "Raspberry Recipes", "Dairy Recipes", "Cherry", "Chocolate", "Recipes for a Crowd"], "photo_url": "http://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2004/6/3/0/jt1b07_moon_desert3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1371584001366.jpeg"},

Transfer the design to foam board and cut out the pieces. It is helpful to construct a 3-D version of your centerpiece before you make it from chocolate. You can make any design and any size you like. My centerpiece design included a large moon with a flame and other flame pieces. Then I made a total of 4 thin single flames and 4 thick double flame pieces. The tallest flames I made were about 28 inches long with 3 progressively shorter flames. Trace the foam board design onto the rubber mat and cut out the moon design to make the template. Repeat to make the flame designs. Make the moon design and the flames in dark chocolate: Place the rubber mat moon design cut out on a parchment paper lined surface. Use a ladle to fill the cut out with chocolate. Allow the chocolate to set. When the chocolate has set, peel away the mat. Repeat to make other flame pieces. Make a base: Use flexible aluminum strips or cake ring to form a base. The base I made was 10 inches in diameter. Place it on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered dark chocolate inside the ring to form a 3/8-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper. Make the chocolate plate: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a 10-inch sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Use a paring knife to trace around an 8-inch cake circle. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Make the white chocolate moon design and the thin flames: Use the templates for the moon and flames as a guide and draw slightly thinner versions of these things onto acetate. Cut out the acetate pieces. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate over the acetate pieces. When the chocolate has set, remove acetate from the chocolate piece and place each one on top of its existing dark version. Use tempered chocolate to glue each 1 into place. Use an airbursh to paint the white chocolate pieces red.\n            ", "\n              Make the chocolate flowers: Each flower consists of about 13 or more petals. Some petals are about 3-inches long while others are about 4 inches long. I used a lot of flower petals so I made my own petal templates. To do this, I drew the shape of the petal at 1 end of a piece of plastic (like plastic from the side of a bucket) that was about 10 inches long and 5 inches wide. Repeat to draw as many petals as will fit on the plastic. Use an X-acto knife to cut out the petals. Repeat to make another template for the 3-inch petals. Place the template on a piece of parchment paper. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over the template. Let the chocolate set slightly. Lift the template from the chocolate. Place the parchment paper over a rolling pin to give the petals a slight curve. You will need petals of varying degrees of curves. Make as many petals as you will need to make as many flowers as your design requires. Assemble the flowers: I used a plastic dome mold to give my flowers their final shape. You could also use a small glass bowl. Place a small dollop of white chocolate in the bottom of the mold. Add petals resting the ends in the chocolate and the tops along the side of the bowl. Add another layer. Continue this process to make as big of a flower as you like. I used the petals with the sharpest curve for the inside layer. When the chocolate has set, pop the finished flower out of the mold. Use an airbrush to paint the flower. Assemble the centerpiece: Use tempered chocolate to adhere the moon design to the base. Use more chocolate to adhere the flames to the base. I glued 1 flame slightly behind the moon design piece and the other slightly in front of the piece. Use more tempered chocolate to glue the flower to the base at the front. Determine the points at which the chocolate plate will rest inside the base of the moon design. Use a hot paring knife to create a 90-degree indentation on the inside of the moon. To do this, heat the knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to \"cut\" through the chocolate by melting it. Create the same type of indentation on the plate where it will rest near the tip of the moon. Balance the plate into the spot you have created using the tempered chocolate to glue it into place. If you are using this as a dessert display, place any dessert that you have on the chocolate plate.\n            ", "\n              Sources: Chocolate Melter: Demarle New Jersey, Demarle.com Chocolate Cold Spray: PCB in France 011 33 0388 587333 Foam board: any art supply store Rubber mat material: hardware store\n            "], "difficulty": "Advanced", "recipe_name": "Chocolate Moonscape Centerpiece", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "5 hr", "servings": "1 centerpiece", "recipe_author": "Chocolate with Jacques Torres", "category_tags": ["French Recipes", "European Recipes", "Candy Recipes and Ideas", "Chocolate"], "photo_url": "http://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2004/6/3/0/jt1b07_moonscape_centerpi_1.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1385516043634.jpeg"},

Line two 9 1/2-by-14-inch jelly-roll pans with parchment paper, leaving 1 inch of paper hanging over on all sides (this will help you lift the cakes out of the pan after baking). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the yolks and 1 cup of the sugar on medium speed until the mixture is thick and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vanilla and mix for 1 minute. Scrape into a medium mixing bowl and set aside. Wash the stand mixer bowl and whisk very well (even the smallest amount of yolk will prevent the whites from whipping properly). Put the whites and salt in the mixer bowl whisk at medium speed until he whites become frothy. Slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar. Increase the speed to high and whip until the whites become glossy and almost firm (the whites should not become dry). Remove the bowl from the mixer. Sift the cocoa over the egg yolk mixture and gently fold in one-third of the whites (this will help to prevent overmixing). Add the remaining whites and carefully fold until there are no visible streaks of white. Divide the batter between the two pans. Smooth the batter evenly with an offset spatula. Bake the cakes just until they have risen and feel like soft marshmallows, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the pans to wire racks and let the cakes cool to room temperature. Chill the cakes until cold, about 30 minutes. While the cakes are cooling, prepare the buttercream. For the peanut buttercream: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and peanut butter on medium speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Turn the speed to low, add the confectioners' sugar, salt and vanilla and mix for another 2 minutes. Add the cream, turn the speed to high, and beat for 1 minute. Cover and set aside. When cooled, remove the cakes from the refrigerator. Gently lift one cake from the pan, using the overhanging parchment as handles, and place it on a cutting board. Carefully separate the paper from the cake. Lay a piece of parchment on top of the cake and quickly flip the cake over. Remove the parchment and replace with a clean sheet of parchment. With a rolling pin, firmly roll over the cake to even it out and thin it out. Trim each cake to a 12-by-9-inch rectangle. Place in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes; this firms it up, and if the cake is stuck to the parchment this allows you to flip one more time to release the paper. Repeat with the remaining cake. Spread a thin layer of jelly over the surface of both cakes. Divide the buttercream between the cakes and spread it evenly over the jelly, leaving a border at the top of one long side. (The rolls look best when the cake layer and buttercream layer are the same thickness.) Begin rolling up the cakes, one at a time, starting at a long side. The first roll is the most important-keep it tight. Continue rolling toward the top. It's best to go slowly and carefully. When you completed rolling a cake into a log, place it in the center of a new sheet of parchment. Take the paper above the roll and cover the roll with a little overlap. Now take a flat-edge utensil, like a bench scraper or a long spatula, and force it underneath the roll and push tight. This helps fill in any air pockets in the roll. Chill the rolls 15 to 20 minutes or overnight before cutting them; the colder, the better. For the chocolate shell: Put the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set it over a pan with 3 inches of simmering water. When the chocolate is completely melted, stir in the butter and oil. Set aside in a warm place.\u00a0\n            ", "\n              Remove the paper from the rolls. With a sharp knife, cut each roll into 6 even pieces; each will be about 2 inches wide. Place a screen over a sheet pan to allow excess chocolate to drip off. Working with one piece at a time, place a piece into the chocolate shell. Flip the piece over using a fork. Lift it out of the chocolate and tap off excess chocolate before setting it on the screen. Continue until each roll is completely coated. Move each roll slightly on the screen during drying so it doesn't stick. Once dry, carefully lift off the rolls and arrange them on a sheet pan. The rolls can be eaten right away or refrigerated, covered, for up to 4 days. Let them come to room temperature before serving.\n            "], "difficulty": "Intermediate", "recipe_name": "Chocolate Peanut Butter and Jelly Rolls", "inactive_time": "2 hr", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "20 min", "servings": "12 servings", "recipe_author": "Hedy Goldsmith", "category_tags": ["Peanut Butter", "Chocolate"], "photo_url": "http://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2014/12/1/0/FN_Hedy-Goldsmith-Chocolate-PB-Rolls-1_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1417555549107.jpeg"},

Scrape the mold clean with an offset spatula and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. It may be necessary to give each mold more than one coat. This will make the candy dish stronger. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a chef's knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks.

Using a large spoon or ladle, randomly drizzle white and bittersweet chocolate onto the plastic. Using an offset spatula, spread the two drizzled chocolates evenly, creating a marbled effect. You can make the base whatever size and shape you'd like it to be, however make sure it is at least 1/4-inch thick. Place in the refrigerator. For the Fish Mold: If you would like your chocolate fish to be painted on the outside, start by mixing together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food coloring, making as many colors as you'd like. (Please note: The easiest way to work with chocolate paints is to store them in a yogurt machine to keep them warm.) Using a paintbrush, paint the inside of the mold, applying color wherever you are inspired to do so (eyes, fins, etc.) and let dry. Using a ladle, fill the fish mold or shell with white chocolate. When it is full, empty the excess chocolate back into the bowl. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the lip of the mold clean, and place it upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip clean again with a paring knife. This is very important because once the chocolate sets, it will shrink or retract from the sides of the mold, and a clean edge will prevent it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Once the chocolate has hardened, remove it from the mold, glue the two halves together with chocolate and let harden. Repeat with as many fish molds or shells as you like. For the Seaweed and Sea Grass: Make 2 cornets and fill 1 with bittersweet chocolate and the other with white chocolate. Draw some seaweed onto parchment paper using bittersweet chocolate then repeat the same technique with the white chocolate, painting over the bittersweet. Use this same technique to draw sea grass. When the chocolate sets, peel off the parchment paper, and reserve for assembly. For the Coral: Place large ice cubes in a tall, round plastic container. Pour the untempered bittersweet chocolate over the cubes and let set until the cubes have completely melted. Remove the chocolate from the container, drain off, and discard the excess water. For the Final Seascape: Arrange the pieces as you would like on the bubble wrap base and \"glue\" them down using the melted chocolate. If you place all of the pieces in the refrigerator first, the sculpture will set faster, as the cold chocolate will cause the \"glue\" to harden and set quickly.\n            ", "\n              How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.\n            ", "\n              How to Make a Cornet (From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): The Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations. Cut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between two fingers of one hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side. Release your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the two corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be one point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size.\n            "], "difficulty": "Advanced", "recipe_name": "Chocolate Seascape", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": ["Special equipment, See source link for information: Bubble wrap Fish mold or shell Tall, round plastic container"], "prep_time": "5 hr", "servings": "1 sculpture", "recipe_author": "Chocolate with Jacques Torres", "category_tags": ["French Recipes", "European Recipes", "Candy Recipes and Ideas", "Chocolate", "Pureeing Recipes"], "photo_url": "http://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2005/5/2/0/jt1a01_chocolate_seascape.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1386371405643.jpeg"},

When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Depending on the thickness of the chocolate, you may want to repeat this step to make the swan thicker. Unmold the chocolate swan. When the chocolate has completely set, the swans are ready to fill with candy. To mold the treasure chest: Use a clean paintbrush or pastry brush to apply dark chocolate to the inside details of the mold. I painted the hinges and fasteners dark chocolate. Use a ladle to fill a mold with milk chocolate. Use the same molding technique as used in the swan. You can fill the chest with candy or any special treat. Tie it closed with a ribbon. To make the picture and frame: This technique can be used to make any painted design. I downloaded a clipart image from the internet. A simple design with a lot of color makes the best result. Place your design underneath a piece of acetate. Mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a fine-tipped paintbrush to trace the outline of the painting with a dark-colored paint. Use other paint colors to fill in the design. This will certainly remind you of paint-by-number. Use and airbrush if you want to give it an antique finish. Allow the paint to dry. Pour some white chocolate at the edge of the painted acetate. Pull the raplette through the chocolate pulling the chocolate over the painted drawing. This will spread an even 1/8-inch thick layer of chocolate over the painting. When the chocolate begins to set, use a sharp paring knife to cut the paint canvas to the finished size of the painting. Let this cool until the chocolate sets. When the chocolate has set completely, simply peel off the acetate. Use a brush dipped in dark chocolate to brush a very light layer of dark chocolate over the relief of the picture frame mold. Use a ladle or cornet filled with white chocolate to fill the mold with white chocolate. When the chocolate sets, unmold the picture frame. The dark chocolate will leave an antique effect. Use tempered white chocolate to glue the chocolate canvas into the frame. It is ready for display. Make the sleigh: Make a template for the sleigh skis and the sleigh bottom. You can make this any size that you like. The bottom of my sleigh measured 11 inches wide by 17 inches long. I used a wood grain tool normally used in house painting to give the sleigh the texture of wood. To make the wood grain chocolate, pour a little dark chocolate at the edge of a piece of parchment paper that measures at least 11 inches wide by 17 inches long. Use a back and forth rocking motion as you pull the wood grain tool through dark chocolate. Be sure to spread this chocolate all the way to the edge of the paper. Repeat the process until the paper is completely filled with the pattern. Repeat on more parchment to create enough wood grain pattern for all of the pieces in your sleigh.\n            ", "\n              Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered milk chocolate over all of the pieces that have the dark chocolate wood grain pattern. When cutting out the skis, use a paring knife to cut through the chocolate while tracing around the template. When the chocolate has set completely, remove the excess chocolate. When the chocolate is set, peel off the parchment. Make the sleigh handle: Roll parchment paper into a tight roll that is about 1/2-inch in diameter. Use a cornet filled with milk chocolate to fill the roll. Be sure to pinch the bottom to keep the chocolate from escaping. Set aside until the roll has set. When the chocolate is hard, remove the parchment paper. Use a hot knife to cut the sleigh handle to the size that will fit onto your sleigh. Assemble: Lay a ski pattern-side down on the work surface. Place tempered milk chocolate in a large cornet and trim the tip. Draw a line of chocolate along the edge of the sleigh bottom. Position the sleigh bottom onto the ski. Draw a line of chocolate on the other edge of the sleigh and position the other ski on top. When the chocolate sets, stand the sleigh upright. Use tempered milk chocolate to glue the sleigh handle into place. The sleigh is ready for any display. Make the Dressy Gift box: To make the strips on the top, you can use a tiling spatula with square teeth cut from it. My box measured 7 inches wide by 10 inches long. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered milk chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Pull the slotted spatula through the chocolate along the longest side. This will leave long straight lines. When the chocolate begins to set, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over strips, being careful not to press into the milk chocolate strips. Let the chocolate set completely. To make the base, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a sheet of parchment paper. Use a paring knife to cut a rectangle that measures 7 inches wide by 10 inches. Then cut 2 strips that measure 61/2 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Cut 2 more strips that measure 91/2 inches long and 11/2 inches wide. When the chocolate has set completely, remove the base and strips. Use tempered chocolate to glue the strips onto the base to form a box. Place the strips just inside the edge of the base. Make the box decorations: Use white modeling chocolate to make the tie, collar, pocket and pocket square. I colored some modeling chocolate red for the pocket square. Get creative and have fun. Dust the work surface with cornstarch. Use a rolling pin to roll out the white modeling chocolate until it is about 1/8-inch thick. Use a paring knife to cut out the details of the shirt or blouse. Place the pieces on top of the striped chocolate box top. If you are inspired to do so, paint some patterns on the tie. When the chocolate has set completely on all of the pieces, the box is ready to be filled with any treat. Simply fill the box and cover with the top piece.

When it is full, empty the excess back into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated. Wipe the lip of the plastic mold clean and place upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip of the mold clean again with a paring knife. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. When set, gently push on one side of the mold and the chocolate cup will release. Repeat to make as many cups as you would like.\n            ", "\n              For the Saucer: Spread 1/4-inch thick layer of white chocolate onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Let the chocolate set until firm yet pliable but not hard. Use the tip of a paring knife to cut a 4 1/2-inch circle. If you are making more than one saucer, make all of the cuts now.

There are a variety of ways to temper.\n            ", "\n              One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.\n            ", "\n              Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.\n            ", "\n              The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.\n            ", "\n              A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.

There are a variety of ways to temper.\n            ", "\n              One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.\n            ", "\n              Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.\n            ", "\n              The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.\n            ", "\n              A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.

Although the term cochon de lait is French, the origin of this Louisiana social event is obscure. It is know that the custom began at least a century ago and has since been popular throughout Cajun country. It is possible that the Germans who settled in St. James Parish in 1690 were the first to introduce the cochon de lait. These settlers brought pigs to the area and were skilled butchers. Local legend, however, tells that veterans of Napoleon's army brought the traditional preparation of cochon de lait to Louisiana in the early 1800s. Many of these soldiers settled in a town in Avoylles Parish they named Manusra in honor of the site of their last major campaign. Since then, Mansura, LA has been designated by the Louisiana legislature as \"La Capital du Cochon de Lait.\"\n            ", "\n              Normally, families cooked pigs in cochon de lait style as the centerpiece for holiday gatherings. The pig, usually weighing less than 30 pounds, was sometimes cooked hanging from the fireplace in the kitchen. The most common method was to cook the pig outdoors over a pecan wood and sugarcane fire. The basic process of the cochon de lait has remained the same over the years. Today, much larger pigs are cooked to feed groups of people. Pigs up to 200 pounds are regarded as excellent for open-fire cooking.\n            ", "\n              When preparing a cochon de lait, season the pig well inside and out with salt, cracked black pepper, and granulated garlic. Inject the front and rear hams and tenderloin with an infused liquid made with 2 cups melted butter, 1 cup white wine, 3/4 cup Louisiana hot sauce and 1/2 cup granulated garlic. Using a meat saw, cut through the backbone at the neck and tail and lay the pig open flat. Wrap the pig in wire mesh that has been washed and cleaned thoroughly and then secure it with wire to hold it in proper form during the long cooking process. The pig should then be slowly rotated in front of a hardwood fire built 3 to 4 feet away from the pig. The fire, constantly maintained, cooks a 50-pound pig in 6 hours. Estimate 1 hour of cooking time for every 10 pounds, but keep in mind that not all pigs will cook at the same rate. After each hour of cooking, flip the pig head side down to ensure even cooking.\n            "], "difficulty": "Intermediate", "recipe_name": "Cochon De Lait", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "20 min", "servings": "1 whole pig", "recipe_author": "FoodNation with Bobby Flay", "category_tags": ["American", "Cajun Restaurants", "Southern Recipes", "Meat", "Pork", "Nut Recipes", "Vegetable", "Main Dish", "Holiday", "Recipes for a Crowd"], "photo_url": "http:N/A"},

If you like, you can roll out the dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on.

In a large bowl, cream the butter, almond paste and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the softened yeast, lemon peel, vanilla, salt, eggs, egg yolk, milk, and 3 cups flour to the creamed mixture. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes. Gradually add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Put the dough into an oiled bowl. Turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise about 1 1/2 hours. Due to the almond paste, this recipe doesn't double in size. Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide in half. Shape each half into a smooth ball. Cover and let rest 5 minutes. Shape one ball of dough into a half oval 12 inches wide and four inches high at the center. Place in the center of a parchment-lined baking sheet. Flatten the center slightly so that when the next piece of dough is laid across it, it won't be so thick. Shape the other ball of dough into an 8 by 16 by 16-inch triangle Keep the points of the triangle rounded rather than pointed. Lay the triangle, centered, on the flattened part of the half oval. Fold the narrow end over to make the head. Pinch with your fingers to form a beak into the top side of the dough. Fold the other end in the opposite direction to form the tail. Cut 2-inch slits along the bottom edge of the tail and wing tips. Fan them out as for feathers. Cover with a towel and let rise 45 minutes. Again, due to the almond paste, the dough won't rise as high as other types of yeast dough; however, it does rise high during baking. 1. About 10 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 2. Just before baking, beat the egg white until frothy. Lightly brush the dove with the beaten egg white and place thinly sliced almonds, overlapping slightly, on the tail and wings to simulate feathers. Use a small bit of an almond to make the dove's eye (diagram 7). Carefully brush the almond \"feathers\" with the remaining beaten egg white then sprinkle the dove with granulated sugar. 3. Bake for 20 minutes. Cover the bread loosely with foil with the shiny side up. Continue to bake for 10 more minutes, or until the internal temperature of the loaf reaches 190 degrees. 4. Immediately remove dove from baking sheet and cool on a rack.\n            "], "difficulty": "N/A", "recipe_name": "Colomba di Pasqua", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "2 hr 45 min", "servings": "N/A", "recipe_author": "Cooking Live", "category_tags": ["Italian Dessert Recipes", "Italian", "Easter Desserts", "Easter", "Holiday", "Baking", "European Recipes", "Bread", "Nut Recipes", "Fruit"], "photo_url": "http:N/A"},
