(A deep bowl this size makes it more efficient for whipping the yolks thoroughly since it minimizes the surface area.) With an electric hand mixer, whip the yolks on high speed (#10) for 3 to 5 minutes. Add the vanilla, and continue whipping for 15 seconds to incorporate; the mixture should appear thicker, pale yellow, and increased in volume. Test the consistency by lifting some of the mixture with the beaters. If it flows back into the bowl in ribbons that slowly dissolve on the surface, proceed to whipping the whites.

Pour the yolks onto the whites (notice they float on the surface). Using just a few strokes, fold the two together with a rubber spatula. Don't be concerned if some of the yolks remain visible.

Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until the top is golden. (The batter hardly rises during the first 20 to 30 minutes of baking. The low oven temperature allows the batter to absorb heat slowly, so rising is gradual. Toward the end of baking the cake may mound high above the pan's rim. That's fine. As it cools, this dome will contract a bit.) When finished baking, the cake should feel spongy, springing back slightly upon being lightly touched. A toothpick, inserted in the center, comes out free of cake. The toothpick is the last test for this cake before you judge if it is finished baking and remove it from the oven. If in doubt, baking 5 to 7 more minutes will not harm the cake.\u00a0\n            ", "\n              Remove spongecake from the oven, and immediately turn it upside down, positioning the edges of the pan on the inverted glasses. This position, defying gravity, allows the cake to maintain its spongy structure without deflating while cooling. Cool the cake for 2 hours; then turn the pan right side up, and place it on the counter. Though the cake is cool to the touch, let it sit for at least 1 more hour to cool the inside completely. (The cake's structure is less fragile when cool, making removal easier.) To release the spongecake and maintain its shape perfectly, remove it from the pan as follows: Carefully loosen the cake crust that is stuck to the top rim of the pan; insert a thin metal spatula down 1/8 inch, and loosen and free the crust all around the cake. Then tilt and rotate pan, tapping it gently on the counter to free the sponge from the metal sides. Tap more if it is not completely released. Finally, release the spring mechanism, and slowly remove the rim. (You'll notice the cake seemed to have had a slipcover because a thin, crusty layer of cake remains on the springform rim; it's delicious, too.) Now tilt the cake on its side, and gently tap the metal bottom on the counter. Rotate the cake as you tap until the removable bottom appears free. Additional tapping may be necessary before it comes off completely. Patience will ensure a perfectly shaped cake.\n            ", "\n              For the filling: Pour the half and half into a 1 1/2 quart heavy bottomed saucepan, add the 1/2 cup sugar, and stir to combine.

Remove, and pour half of the hot liquid over the yolk mixture, whisking to combine. Pour the yolk mixture into saucepan, and over medium heat bring it to a boil again, stirring constantly. When it is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat, pour it into a 3 quart mixing bowl to cool, and cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a crust from forming on the cream. (This bowl size is to allow room for folding in the whipped cream later.) Pierce the plastic with the tip of a knife to let steam escape and cool faster. Refrigerate.\n            ", "\n              For the glaze: Chop the chocolate into matchstick size pieces with a chef's knife on a dry cutting board. Place first the butter, then the chocolate pieces in the top portion of a 1 1/2 quart double boiler (or a 1 quart mixing bowl that fits snugly over a saucepan or another mixing bowl). Fill the bottom vessel half full with hot tap water (120130 degrees) and place the chocolate/butter bowl on top to melt. You may put the double boiler on the stove over a very low flame just to maintain the water's temperature while melting the mixture if you wish. Stir occasionally to blend until the mixture is smooth, shiny and liquid. Remove from the water, and set aside. Yield: One scant cup.\n            ", "\n              Assembling the Trifle: Split the spongecake evenly into three layers, each about 7/8-inch thick, using a 12inch serrated knife in a sawing motion. Lift the top two layers, one at a time, and set aside (this is easy because each layer is spongy and thick). Stir the vanilla and rum into the cold custard. Whip the heavy cream in a 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl to the Chantilly stage, and fold into the custard mixture. Place the bottom cake layer of cake in a 2 1/2 to 3 quart glass bowl, and cover it with half of the filling, spreading evenly with a rubber spatula.

With a 2inch paring knife, scrape the tip of the blade firmly but gently down a bar of chocolate.

Poach the fish fillets in remainder of fish soup: nohu, opakapaka, John Dory and moano, in that order. The firmest fish requires longer cooking time and should go in first. The moano is very delicate and will not need more than 30 seconds cooking time. Bake the soup in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 minutes. In the bottom of each plate place the vegetable julienne and the sliced potato, distribute in each plate an equal portion of fish and lobster. Arrange as a fan. Sprinkle with diced tomato and fennel leaves. Place in front of each guest the fish plate, the fish soup in crust on the left of each plate. With a small ladle, break the crust and scoop a good helping of soup over your bouillabaisse. Float 1 or 2 croutons topped with the rouille and enjoy.\n            "], "difficulty": "N/A", "recipe_name": "Bouillabaisse", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "15 min", "servings": "8 servings", "recipe_author": "The Best Of", "category_tags": ["Seafood Soup", "Shellfish Recipes", "Soup", "Carrot Soup", "Vegetable Soup", "Carrot Recipes", "Vegetable", "Potato Soup", "Potato", "Tomato Soup"], "photo_url": "http:N/A"},

There are a variety of ways to temper.\n            ", "\n              One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.\u00a0\n            ", "\n              Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.\u00a0\n            ", "\n              The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.\n            "], "difficulty": "Intermediate", "recipe_name": "Branches", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "55 min", "servings": "50 pieces, depending on the si", "recipe_author": "Passion for Dessert with Jacques Torres", "category_tags": ["Food Processor", "American", "Candy Recipes and Ideas", "Chocolate", "Nut Recipes", "Dessert", "Pureeing Recipes", "Microwave Recipes"], "photo_url": "http:N/A"},

Fill the molds half-full with the custard and set them in a roasting pan in the oven (it is much easier to transfer the pan with the molds only half-full). Fill the molds to the top with the custard.

Use hot water from the tap and pour enough water into the roasting pan to reach halfway up the sides of the molds. When baked correctly, the custard should tremble slightly when gently shaken. In a conventional oven, this should take about 1 hour 15 minutes for a large mold, 45 minutes for individual molds. If you detect any liquid under the skin, the custard is under baked. Put it back in the oven and shake it every 5 minutes until it is ready.

To quick soak, rinse the beans and place in a large pot. Cover with cold water to about 3 inches above the top of the beans. Bring the pot to a boil, cover and immediately remove from the heat. Let sit for 1 hour, drain, rinse and return the beans to the pot.\u00a0\n            ", "\n              Cover the beans with fresh cold water to 3 to 4 inches above the level of the beans (this will require more water than the previous time, as the beans will have expanded during the quick soak). Add to the pot the carrot, celery, onion, garlic, thyme, parsley, bay leaf and salt. All the vegetables can and should be left whole, as they will be easier to remove later. (I add the salt at the beginning of cooking, as I find it adds better flavor to the beans. Many people believe that adding salt too early will make the beans tough, but I have never found this to be the case.) Bring the liquid to a boil, and immediately reduce to the barest simmer, just barely bubbling very gently. Cook, uncovered, until the beans are done, roughly 1 to 2 hours. The timing will vary greatly with the size and variety of beans, the size of your pot, your elevation, the weather, etc. Just taste-test along the way until they are fully cooked through but not mushy. Once done, remove the pot from the heat. I generally remove all the aromatics and then store the beans in their own cooking liquid in the fridge in a sealed container. They will last 1 to 2 weeks that way. The liquid is delicious. Yield: makes enough for 6 to 10 burritos, depending on appetite.\n            ", "\n              In a medium saucepan heat the oil over medium heat.

Pour the hot fruit puree over the chopped milk chocolate. The hot puree will melt the milk chocolate. Use a whisk to mix the chocolate and fruit puree. Add the butter and continue to whisk. Continually whisk while adding the alcohol and the corn syrup. Mix until well combined with no remaining lumps. Let this cool. Must be less than 88 degrees or it will melt the chocolate molded inside each cavity. Paint the molds: Place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and apply color to the empty molds. This is what will give the finished chocolates their color. Repeat to paint as many molds as you have. Mold the chocolates: Use a ladle to fill the mold with white chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of each cavity should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean with an offset spatula and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the mold again with an offset spatula. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat to fill as many molds as you have. Place the raspberry ganache in a piping bag and pipe it into the chocolate filled molds. Leave just enough room for the layer of chocolate that closes the mold. Let set in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or overnight. To close the bottoms of each cavity, use tempered white chocolate and apply with an offset spatula. Scrape clean and allow to them to set. You can place them in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. When the chocolate has set, invert the mold over a clean dry surface.

To test the saltiness of the brine put egg, in shell in the cooled brine. If it doesn't float, add enough salt until it does. To draw off any excess blood and to help the brine penetrate, pierce the beef all over with a trussing needle or skewer and place meat in cold water for about 45 minutes. Remove the meat from water and place in crock or bucket. Pour the cooled brine over the brisket. Add garlic to the brine. Place a plate on top of the brisket to submerge.

Allow 3 to 10 days for salting time for brisket. When removing meat from brine, always use clean tongs: this way the brine will stay good longer and be reused with the same kind of meat.

Or place all meat, bones and vegetables on baking sheet and brown in oven and then add to stockpot. When browned, add cold water to cover them by 2 inches, Bring to a simmer at medium heat. As the liquid starts to simmer, scum will rise. Remove it with a ladle for about 20 minutes until it stops to accumulate. Add the bouquet garni and add more water if necessary -- water should cover all ingredients by 1 inch. When liquid is simmering again, skim as necessary. Keep at a simmer for 4 to 5 minutes. Skim fat and scum occasionally. Boiling water should be added if the liquid evaporates below the level of all ingredients. Never allow the liquid to boil to avoid fat and scum incorporating themselves into the liquid and making it cloudy. Cooking may be stopped at any time and continued later. Never cover the pot totally before contents have completely cooled -- otherwise the stock will turn sour. After 4 to 5 hours of cooking, strain the stock out of the stockpot into a bowl. Press on the vegetables, to squeeze out all the liquid. Discard the vegetables. Let stock settle for 5 minutes. Remove fat from its surface with a ladle, then draw paper towels over the surface of the stock to blot up last traces of fat. Or put the stock into the refrigerator, uncovered, until fat on top has hardened and can be scraped off. Taste the degreased stock for taste. Boil it down to evaporate some of its water content and to concentrate its strength. Chill in ice-bath. Cover and refrigerate it, or bottle and freeze it.

Add the cream and stir gently until the mixture is smooth and dark. If necessary (if the cream was too cold and the mixture not entirely smooth), return it to the heat until totally fluid and uniform in color. As soon as the brownie is removed from the oven, grease the end if a wooden spoon (no larger than 1/2-inch diameter) and insert it into the brownie, at 1-inch intervals, all the way to the bottom, twisting slightly, as you insert and withdraw it, to create 23 to 28 little holes. Using as small spoon to pour or a zipzeal bag with a small piece of the corner cut, fill the holes until slightly rounded (you will need at least 1/2 teaspoon for each). Place the pan on a wire rack and cool completely. The chocolate puddles will sink in as it cools and more ganache can be added, to fill any depressions, as long as the brownie is still warm enough to melt it. (If necessary, you can set the tart under a lamp to heat the ganache puddles and make them smooth.) Unmold by placing the pan on a canister smaller than the opening for the loose bottom and pressing sides firmly down. To remove the parchment, refrigerate the tart or allow it to sit at room temperature until the puddles are firm to the touch. Cover a flat plate with plastic wrap, spray it lightly with non-stick vegetable spray and set it in top of tart. Invert the tart; peel off the parchment, and reinvert it onto a serving plate. To serve, use a thin, sharp knife to cut wedges. Serve accompanied by a scoop of coffee or vanilla ice cream and any leftover ganache reheated as sauce.\n            "], "difficulty": "N/A", "recipe_name": "Brownie Puddle", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "N/A", "servings": "N/A", "recipe_author": "Cooking Live", "category_tags": ["Chocolate Cookie Recipes", "Chocolate", "Cookie", "Easter Desserts", "Dessert", "Easter", "Holiday", "Baking", "Brownie", "Cheese"], "photo_url": "http:N/A"},

If you're using Streusel, break up the pieces with your fingertips and use a smidge on each puff-put it on and press it down very, very lightly.

With a little persistence, you will soon have a dough (although somewhat sticky) that you can knead. Turn out onto a well-floured kneading surface and knead for 6 or 7 minutes.

Divide the dough into 8 pieces, and flatten each on a well-floured bread board. With a rolling pin, roll out one or two breads until very thin, about 8 to 10 inches in diameter. Work with only one or two at a time, as many as will fit in your oven. When ready, handle the bread gently as you place it on the hot tiles. (You can also try dusting a peel or the back of a baking sheet with flour and using peel or sheet to transfer breads to hot tiles.) Bake on one side for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes then turn over to the other side for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. The bread should begin to brown around the outside. When baked, keep breads warm by stacking them one on top of the other and wrapping them in a clean kitchen towel.

Work dough into a ball in the center of the bowl and sprinkle lightly with flour so it won't stick to your hands. Lift ball of dough out and knead gently on a floured dough board or smooth surface.

White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.\n            ", "\n              Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate.

It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.\n            ", "\n              The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.\n            ", "\n              A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself.\n            ", "\n              Start with 2 pieces of colored sugar. I used red and green. Pull them into a rectangular shape that is about 1 1/2-inches wide by 3-inches long and 1/2-inch thick. Place the pieces side-to-side and let them stick together on the long side. Place a piece of white sugar that is about 1/2-inch wide by 3-inches long and 1/2-inch thick in the middle. Close the red and green around it. Roll it and twist it while pulling it. When it gets to the desired thickness, use a scissor to cut the length and shape into a cane. Allow to cool completely. The white is inside and will become apparent when eaten.\n            ", "\n              Jacques? tips: Vinegar keeps the sugar from crystallizing. You will not taste the flavor. It serves as an acid in this recipe. Sometimes candy cane recipes contain corn syrup, which makes the sugar very dry and very hot. Adding corn syrup makes it more difficult to work with the sugar at home. Remember, the sugar is at 320 degrees F, and that will burn you. The ideal work surface is a silpat placed over cool marble or granite. If you do not have marble or stone, use wood. It is a good idea to use gloves to help protect your hands from the heat and to prevent burning.\n            ", "\n              I use a special sugar box that includes a special heat source, If you don?t have one, you can work in front of the oven.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself.\n            ", "\n              Start with 2 pieces of colored sugar. I used red and green. Pull them into a rectangular shape that is about 1 1/2-inches wide by 3-inches long and 1/2-inch thick. Place the pieces side-to-side and let them stick together on the long side. Place a piece of white sugar that is about 1/2-inch wide by 3-inches long and 1/2-inch thick in the middle. Close the red and green around it. Roll it and twist it while pulling it. When it gets to the desired thickness, use a scissor to cut the length and shape into a cane. Allow to cool completely. The white is inside and will become apparent when eaten.\n            ", "\n              Jacques? tips: Vinegar keeps the sugar from crystallizing. You will not taste the flavor. It serves as an acid in this recipe. Sometimes candy cane recipes contain corn syrup, which makes the sugar very dry and very hot. Adding corn syrup makes it more difficult to work with the sugar at home. Remember, the sugar is at 320 degrees F, and that will burn you. The ideal work surface is a silpat placed over cool marble or granite. If you do not have marble or stone, use wood. It is a good idea to use gloves to help protect your hands from the heat and to prevent burning.\n            ", "\n              I use a special sugar box that includes a special heat source, If you don?t have one, you can work in front of the oven.

Starting on the right side, and leaving a 1-inch border, slap and spread on the butter, using your fingers, over two-thirds of the rectangle. Fold the dough into thirds; starting with the left side, fold at the butter line as if closing a book, and then fold the right side up and over the top layer.

To begin your first turn, turn the dough 90 degrees on your work surface so the closed fold is at the top and, rolling lengthwise, roll It into a 20 by 10-inch rectangle. Brush off any excess flour and fold into thirds as above, starting with the left side and ending with the right. At this point, you have finished one turn. Rotate the dough 90 degrees so the closed fold is at the top, and repeat the rolling and folding process. The second turn is complete. After the second turn, or any time the dough is too soft to work with, transfer to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate, covered in plastic wrap, for about 30 minutes, or until the dough is chilled and relaxed. Each time the dough is refrigerated, make an indentation in the dough with your fingertip for each turn completed.

Make the frittata base by mixing together the heavy cream, creme fraiche, Parmesan, salt, white pepper and eggs. Set aside in the fridge. At Craftsman and Wolves, we like to use fresh seasonal vegetables in our frittata. However, the wonderful thing about this dish is you can use whatever is in your fridge. Start by either sauteing or roasting your vegetables. If you are sauteing, you can use the same pan to cook the frittata. If you have leftover vegetables, make sure to thoroughly warm them in your frittata pan before adding the egg mixture. This will keep the vegetables from sticking to the bottom of the pan when you serve the frittata. Once your vegetables are cooked, set a 9-inch pan over medium-high heat. Evenly coat the canola oil around the sides and bottom of your pan. When the oil starts to smoke a little, turn down the heat to medium and add your vegetables so that they form a even layer on the bottom of your pan. After 1 minute, add your frittata mixture. It should sizzle up the side of the pan. Turn your heat down to medium-low and let the frittata cook. Once the edges of the frittata are set, transfer to the oven and cook just until the center is set, 16 to 20 minutes. Allow the frittata to cool for 5 minutes, and then run a butter knife around the side to loosen it from the pan. Invert onto a cutting board and cool 10 minutes. Re-flip the frittata onto a plate, cut into 4 to 6 slices and serve!\n            "], "difficulty": "Easy", "recipe_name": "Cast Iron Frittata from Craftsman and Wolves", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "N/A", "servings": "4 to 6 servings", "recipe_author": "N/A", "category_tags": ["Cast Iron Skillet", "Frittata", "Egg Recipes", "Main Dish", "Sauteing Recipes"], "photo_url": "http:N/A"},
