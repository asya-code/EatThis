In order to grow, it requires warmth, moisture and nourishment. The yeast feeds on the sugar and produces bubbles of carbon dioxide which causes the bread to rise. Heat of over 122 degrees F/50 degrees C will kill yeast. Have the ingredients and equipment at blood heat. White or brown sugar, honey golden syrup, treacle or molasses may be used. Each will give a slightly different flavour to the bread. At Ballymaloe we use treacle.

Different flours produce breads of different textures and flavour. The amount of natural moisture in the flour varies according to atmospheric conditions.

The main ingredients - wholemeal flour, treacle and yeast are highly nutritious.\n            ", "\n              Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F/230 degrees C/gas mark 8.\n            ", "\n              Mix the flour with the salt.

Put the tin in a warm place somewhere close to the cooker or near a radiator perhaps. Cover the tins with a tea towel to prevent a skin from forming.

The base I made was 19-inches in diameter. Place it on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered dark chocolate inside the ring to form a 1/2-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper. Make a support pole: Roll a 35-inch long piece of parchment paper into a cone that has a bottom diameter of 2 1/2 inches and tapers to a point. Tape it closed. This piece will support the mold so make sure it is long enough and thick enough to support the centerpiece you are making. Set the cone on end and fill with dark chocolate. When it is full, invert the cone over the bowl of chocolate allowing the excess chocolate to flow back into the bowl. Spin the cone so the chocolate inside is evenly coated. Let set. When the chocolate has set, repeat this step a few more times. You want the cone to be sturdy because the rest of the centerpiece will rest on this cone. Allow the chocolate cone to set until hard. Remove the parchment paper. Use a hot knife to trim the base of the cone so it is flat. Then use the knife to scar the bottom of the cone and the base. You want to make it somewhat textured so it will form a better seal to the base. Use tempered chocolate to glue the pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the molded chocolate against it.\n            ", "\n              Make the pails, fish, starfish, lobster, and claim shells: Tip: Alternate the molds using white, dark and milk chocolates to make a more interesting centerpiece. Use a ladle to fill a mold with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many shell or fish molds as you would like. To make the flowers and the leaves: Use a paintbrush to apply color to the inside of each flower and leaf mold where you are inspired to do so. Place white chocolate in a cornet and use it to fill each of the painted molds. Tap the molds on the surface to help the air bubbles escape. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many flowers and leaves as you would like to make. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate the molded objects as you are inspired. If you want to paint the molded chocolate pieces, mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to paint each piece, applying color where you are inspired to do so. You can also apply color directly to the mold before filling it with chocolate. This works especially well for the chocolate flowers.\n            ", "\n              Make seaweed and sea grass: Make 2 cornets and fill 1 with tempered dark chocolate and the other with tempered white chocolate. Use the dark chocolate to draw some seaweed onto a sheet of parchment paper. Repeat the same technique using the white chocolate to paint randomly over the dark chocolate. Use this same technique to draw sea grass. When the chocolate sets, remove the parchment paper. Make the sun: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Use a paring knife to cut the chocolate into a star or sun shape. The one I made was about 11 inches in diameter. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Paint the decoration as inspired. Make the chocolate curls: Use a block of white chocolate. Pull a vegetable peeler over the edge to create chocolate curls. Use the curls to decorate the base of the centerpiece and the cakes. Assemble: Use a hot sharp chef's knife or small round cutter to cut a hole in each beach pail so it can be placed in the support pole. To do this, heat the knife or cutter under very hot water and wipe it dry. If you have a blowtorch, you can also use that to heat the metal. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife/cutter or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the metal to \"cut\" through the chocolate by melting it. Use more chocolate to glue the sun/star to the top of the support pole. Arrange the rest of the decorations as inspired to do so.\n            "], "difficulty": "Advanced", "recipe_name": "Beach Toy Centerpiece", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "3 hr", "servings": "1 centerpiece", "recipe_author": "Chocolate with Jacques Torres", "category_tags": ["French Recipes", "European Recipes", "Lobster", "Shellfish Recipes", "Chocolate", "Dessert"], "photo_url": "http://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2004/6/3/0/jt1b05_beach_toy_centerpiece.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1385516039417.jpeg"},

Sift the flour and toss it with the almond and sugar powder. Whip the egg whites in an electric mixer at low speed until they start to froth. If you are not whipping the whites in a copper bowl, then add the cream of tartar at this point. Gradually increase the whipping speed to medium-high, and continue whipping until the whites form very stiff peaks and just begin to slip and streak around the side of the bowl. Add the superfine sugar and continue whipping at high speed for a few seconds longer to incorporate the sugar and tighten the meringue. Gently fold in the almond and sugar powder and flour. Scoop the batter into the pastry bag, and pipe the batter in domes 1-inch wide, arranging them on the baking sheets in staggered rows and separating them by about 1-inch. Unless you have 2 ovens, pipe only 1 sheet of cookies at a time, and keep the remaining batter in the pastry bag until the first sheet is baked. Dust chopped almonds over the piped batter. Turn the baking sheet upside down and tap it with a wooden spatula to dislodge the excess almonds, then quickly turn the baking sheet right side up again. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Let rest for about 1 minute to allow some of the confectioners' sugar to dissolve. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until the cookies are lightly browned on the bottom and dry and crusty on top, but still soft inside, about 15 to 18 minutes. Place the baking sheet on a wire rack and let the cookies cool. While they are still warm and before the batter sets, carefully transfer them to a wire rack with a metal spatula. Then let them finish cooling on the wire rack. Press the center of each dome on the flat side with your fingertip to make a slight depression. Turn half the domes upside down and spoon about 1/2 teaspoon of apricot jam on the center of each. Then place a second dome right side up on top of each to make a sandwich. Lightly dust the balls with confectioners' sugar, then turn them upside down and dust the other side as well. Storage: Covered airtight in a tin cookie box or a cookie jar for up to 4 to 6 days. They look best if they are dusted with confectioners' sugar shortly before serving.\n            "], "difficulty": "N/A", "recipe_name": "Blidas", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "30 min", "servings": "about 30 cookies", "recipe_author": "Emeril Live", "category_tags": ["Mixer Recipes", "French Recipes", "European Recipes", "Cookie", "Nut Recipes", "Apricot", "Fruit", "Dessert", "Kid-Friendly"], "photo_url": "http://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2003/12/18/0/em1d16_blidas.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1371584038756.jpeg"},

Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-by-3-inch round cake pan with removable bottom with the melted butter and line the bottom with a 9-inch-diameter parchment paper round. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip together the eggs and sugar at medium-high speed until the mixture is very thick and falls in heavy ribbons, about 7 minutes. In a separate bowl, whisk together the oil, ricotta, orange juice, and vanilla. Gently add the ricotta mixture to the egg mixture and whip just until blended. Sift together the flour and baking powder. Add the sifted ingredients to the batter, mixing just until incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Do not over mix. If necessary, finish folding in the sifted ingredients by hand, using a rubber spatula. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and place on a rack in the center of the oven. Bake the cake until lightly browned on top, about 70 minutes. The cake is done when a knife blade inserted into the center comes out clean and when the top of the cake springs back lightly when touched. Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool completely. Once cooled, remove the cake from the pan and peel parchment paper from bottom of the cake. Wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap until ready to use. The Ricotta Pound Cake can be stored for up to 1 day at room temperature or in the freezer for up to 1 week. For the blood orange simple syrup: Combine the sugar with 1/3 cup water in a small, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat, pour into a clean bowl, and allow to cool. Once fully cooled, stir in the blood orange concentrate until combined. The Blood Orange Simple Syrup will keep for up to 7 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. For the blood orange curd: Soften the gelatin sheet in 2 cups cool water for 3 minutes. Combine the whole eggs, egg yolks, sugar and both juices into a heatproof, nonreactive mixing bowl set over a pan of simmering water (do not allow the bowl to touch the water) and whisk together until the sugar begins to dissolve. Cook, whisking continuously, until the mixture begins to thicken into a custard, 5 to 7 minutes. If using a candy thermometer, cook to 170 to 180 degrees F. Whisk the butter. The curd should be smooth and homogenous. Squeeze out the excess water from the gelatin and whisk the gelatin into the hot mixture until fully dissolved and combined. Remove the bowl from over the water and strain the curd through a medium-mesh sieve into a clean, nonreactive mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface of the curd and allow to cool in the refrigerator. The Blood Orange Curd can be stored for up to 3 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. For the cranberry orange preserves: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, pulse together the cranberries and orange juice. The cranberries should still be in chunky pieces. Combine the cranberry mixture with the corn syrup and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Stirring every 5 minutes, cook the mixture until it boils and thickens, 15 to 20 minutes. If using a candy thermometer, cook to approx. 210 degrees F. Transfer to a clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and cool in the refrigerator. The Cranberry Orange Preserves can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\n            ", "\n              For the blood orange whipped cream: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip together the cream and sugar until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the Blood Orange Curd until combined, being careful not to over mix, which could make the stiffened whipped cream weak. The Blood Orange Whipped Cream should be made when ready to assemble the cake. To assemble the cake: In a small mixing bowl, gently fold together the raspberries and the Cranberry Orange Preserves until combined. Place the unwrapped pound cake on a flat work surface. Using a long serrated knife, slice off the top 1/4-inch to even out the top of the cake as necessary. Slice the cake horizontally into 3 even layers. Using a 10-inch round cake board as the bottom of a 10-by-3-inch round cake pan with removable bottom, center 1 cake layer on the cake board, cut side up. Using a pastry brush, moisten the cake layer with one-third of the Blood Orange Simple Syrup. Measure out 1 1/2 cups of Blood Orange Whipped Cream and set aside to be used to frost the top of the cake. Using an offset spatula, spread half of the remaining Blood Orange Whipped Cream onto the syrup-soaked cake layer, allowing the whipped cream to fill up the space between the cake and the cake pan. Use a rubber spatula to gently but firmly press the whipped cream down in between the side of the cake pan and the cake layer, thus essentially forming the side of the cake. Spoon half of the raspberry-cranberry preserves mixture onto the Blood Orange Whipped Cream, gently pressing the berries onto the cream. Top with a second layer of pound cake and repeat with another one-third of the simple syrup, the other half of the remaining Blood Orange Whipped Cream, and remaining raspberry-cranberry preserves mixture. Top with the final layer of cake and moisten with the remaining Blood Orange Simple Syrup. Using a long, flat spatula, evenly spread the reserved 1 1/2 cups Blood Orange Whipped Cream over the top of the cake. Tightly wrap the cake in the pan in plastic wrap and place in the freezer overnight.\n            "], "difficulty": "Intermediate", "recipe_name": "Blood Orange Ricotta Cake", "inactive_time": "N/A", "special_equipment": [], "prep_time": "30 min", "servings": "One 10-inch cake; 16 to 18 servings", "recipe_author": "Local Flavor", "category_tags": ["Fruit", "Orange Recipes", "Cheese", "Ricotta", "Dessert"], "photo_url": "http://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2015/4/30/0/LocalFlavor_blood-orange-ricotta-cake_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1430427504332.jpeg"},
